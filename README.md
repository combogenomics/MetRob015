Raw data and code related to the manuscript "Metabolic robustness to growth temperature of cold adapted bacterium".

- Raw data:

growth_curve_0_v2.txt and growth_curve_15_v2.txt contain growth (OD) data for growth at 0 and 15 Â°C
Intra_0.txt and Intra_15.txt embedd the raw intracellular metabolomic data used for this work
met_ext_0_not0.txt and met_ext_15_not0.txt embedd the raw extracellular metabolomic data used for this work


- R scripts to generate the figures included in the manuscript are as follows:
1.Figure1.R for generating Figure 1 and analysing growth and uptake data  
2.Figure2_and_5.R for generating Figure 2 and 5 and analysing intracellular metabolomic data, TPM and genome-scale metabolic prediction accuracy
3.Figure3.R for generating Figure 3 and and analysing extracellular metabolomic data

- FBA and genome-scale metabolic modelling.
